# fullstack-challenge

## Objective

- Build the front-end and back-end of a search tool to display and save images from an API
- Submit a PR with your implementation

## Requirements

The project needs to have the following features

- A search input that makes a search of this [nasa api](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf) searching *only images* and displaying them. It doesn't need to have the optional filters, only text search. This is the access token for the api, in case it doesn't work you can get a free key [here](https://api.nasa.gov/)
`HPwiXU4SP5t2jj7CbGcGf1ccqFaW4VgL65hUOQqL`

- Users should have the option to "save" an image, which *downloads* it to the backend. The files should be stored at a ./data folder. There is already a file entity created on the backend but feel free to change it to your convenience

- Users should be able to see the images they downloaded on the frontend.

- The design can be basic, but it needs to be mobile friendly


## Things you do not need to do

- There is no need to deploy this. Creating a pull request with your implementation is enough.

- There is no need to do a pagination/lazy load implementation for the search results. Showing the first hits is enough.

- If you aren't aable to complete it all on time, please write an explanation of what is missing and how would have done it
