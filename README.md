# fullstack-challenge

## Description

The project needs to have the following features

- A search input that makes a search of this [nasa api](https://images.nasa.gov/docs/images.nasa.gov_api_docs.pdf) searching *only images* and shows them, doesn't need to have the optional filters, text search only is good. This is the access token for the api, in case it doesn't work you can get a free key [here](https://api.nasa.gov/)

- when seeing the images you can "save" an image, this *downloads* it to the backend, this files should be stored at a ./data folder. There is already a file entity created on the backend but feel free to change it to your convenience

- I should be able to see the images I downloaded on the frontend

- there is not a need of a fancy/big design, but the site needs to be mobile friendly


## Things you do not need to do

- it's not necesary to deploy this somewhere, with creating a pull request with your implementation it's fine

- there is no need to do a pagination/lazy load implemenation for the search results, showing the first hits it's okey
